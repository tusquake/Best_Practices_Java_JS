JavaScript Best Practices

1. Use `const` and `let` Instead of `var`
- Prefer `const` for variables that do not change.
- Use `let` for variables that may change.
- Avoid `var` to prevent scope-related bugs.

2. Always Use Strict Equality (`===`)
- Use `===` and `!==` instead of `==` and `!=` to avoid unexpected type coercion.

3. Avoid Global Variables
- Limit the use of global variables to reduce the risk of conflicts and bugs.

4. Use Meaningful Variable and Function Names
- Choose descriptive names that make your code easy to understand.

5. Keep Functions Small and Focused
- Each function should do one thing and do it well.

6. Handle Errors Gracefully
- Use `try...catch` for error handling.
- Provide helpful error messages.

7. Comment Wisely
- Write comments to explain "why" something is done, not "what" is done.
- Keep comments up to date.

8. Avoid Deep Nesting
- Refactor deeply nested code into smaller functions.

9. Use Array and Object Methods
- Prefer methods like `.map()`, `.filter()`, `.reduce()`, and `Object.keys()` for cleaner code.

10. Write Unit Tests
- Test your code to catch bugs early and ensure reliability.

11. Use Template Literals for String Concatenation
- Use backticks (`) for easier and readable string interpolation.

12. Prefer Arrow Functions for Short Functions
- Use arrow functions for concise syntax, especially for callbacks.

13. Keep Code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Reuse code and avoid duplication.

14. Use Linters and Formatters
- Tools like ESLint and Prettier help maintain code quality and consistency.
